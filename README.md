# Advanced Sequence Pattern Optimizer

Advanced Sequence Pattern Optimizer is a web-based tool that analyzes numeric sequences and detects complex patterns such as arithmetic, geometric, polynomial, Fibonacci, and more. It also provides statistical insights into sequences, including total sum, average, standard deviation, and monotonicity.

## Features

- Detects common sequence patterns:
  - Arithmetic progression
  - Geometric progression
  - Polynomial sequences
  - Fibonacci and Reverse Fibonacci sequences
  - Prime numbers, square numbers, cube numbers
  - Perfect numbers, binary sequences
  - Monotonic and exponential sequences
- Calculates basic statistics:
  - Total sum of the sequence
  - Average
  - Standard deviation
  - Maximum and minimum values
- Easy-to-use web interface with real-time results and a history log.
